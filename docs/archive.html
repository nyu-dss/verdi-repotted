      <p style="font-family: Century Gothic;"><font size="-1">The archive of the American
      Institute for Verdi Studies is located in Bobst Library of New
      York University. It is believed to be the best-balanced collection
      of research materials relating to the life and music of the composer,
      his wife and members of the Verdi circle in existence today.
      For the most part on film, it consists of 1) Scores and parts,
      2) Librettos, 3) Letters, documents, and other archival materials,
      4) Production materials, 5) Nineteenth-century Italian music
      periodicals, 6) Miscellaneous. &nbsp;(See below for a brief description
      of each category.)</font></p>


      
      <p style="font-family: Century Gothic;"><font size="-1">Descriptions and lists
      of the materials found in the Verdi Archive have been published
      in several issues of the <i><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/verdiforum.html">Verdi Newsletter</a>.</i>
      &nbsp;The American Institute for Verdi Studies is currently in
      the process of preparing searchable online databases of its holdings.</font></p>

      1.</font></b><font size="-1"> <b>SCORES AND
      PARTS.</b></font></p>


      
      <blockquote style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
        <p><font size="-1">a) Approximately 280 manuscript
        and 50 printed orchestral scores, including 32 autographs and
        autograph sketches by Verdi.<br>
        b) About 290 piano-vocal scores of music by Verdi, almost all
        of them printed.<br>
        c) More than 3,000 individual parts (mainly manuscript) and arrangements.
        The arrangements include a sizable amount of materials for the
        stage bands and small orchestras.</font></p></blockquote>


      
      <p style="font-family: Century Gothic;"><b><font size="-1">2.</font></b><font size="-1"> <b>LIBRETTOS AND SCENARIOS</b></font></p>


      
      <blockquote style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
        <p><font size="-1">a) More than 2,200 librettos
        for operas by Verdi, a large majority dating from the nineteenth
        century. A number of the librettos and several scores had manuscript
        additions to facilitate their use as staging manuals. See <b>4.</b>
        below.<br>
        b) MS scenarios (abbreviated prose versions of the librettos),
        libretto drafts (e.g. <i>Ernani, Il trovatore, Simon Boccanegra,
        </i>and <i>Aida</i>), and thirteen scenarios and librettos for
        operas Verdi never completed. These include Shakespeare's <i>King
        Lear, The Tempest, </i>and<i>Cymbaline</i> (as <i>Rowena</i>),
        Moliere's <i>Tartuffe</i>, and Grillparzer's <i>Die Ahnfrau</i>
        (as <i>L'Avola</i>). Versions of the first and last of these
        are in Verdi's own hand.</font></p></blockquote>


      
      <p style="font-family: Century Gothic;"><b><font size="-1">3. LETTERS, DOCUMENTS,
      AND ARCHIVAL MATERIALS</font></b></p>


      
      <blockquote style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
        <p><font size="-1">a) Thousands of letters
        written by the composer and his second wife, Giuseppina Strepponi
        Verdi, both manuscript and printed, including 1,500 to the composer's
        principal publisher, Ricordi, and an equal number from the publisher
        to the Verdis. The latter are included in the immense collection
        of letters to the Verdis and other documents, more than 5,000
        items, filmed at the composer's estate, the Villa Verdi at Sant'Agata.<br>
        b) Drafts of much of the correspondence from the Verdis preserved
        in notebooks (<i>Copialettere</i>) and also filmed at Sant'Agata.
        Those by Verdi began in 1844 and run to the end of his life.
        They were published in 1913, not however without some mistakes
        and important omissions. Those of Giuseppina began in1860, shortly
        after their marriage in 1859, and have been published only in
        small part and badly.<br>
        c) Financial documents, contracts and records of monies borrowed
        or loaned, as well as lists of performances of individual operas
        that were kept by Verdi to verify royalty payments, included
        in both sets of the <i>Copialettere,</i> have never been published.<br>
        d) More than 3,100 letters to Ricordi from important musicians
        (e.g. Franz Liszt, Emanuele Muzio, and Angelo Mariani) and singers
        from the archive of Casa Ricordi.<br>
        e) The manuscript ledgers (<i>libroni</i>) of Casa Ricordi and
        Lucca, which record the dates work began and was ended for almost
        every item in the publication list of the Milanese publishers.<br>
        f) Materials from four theater archives (Venice, La Fenice ,
        Parma, Teatro Regio, Trieste, Teatro Giuseppe Verdi, and Brussels,
        Théâtre de la Monnaie).</font></p></blockquote>


      
      <p style="font-family: Century Gothic;"><b><font size="-1">4. PRODUCTION MATERIALS</font></b></p>


      
      <blockquote style="font-family: Century Gothic;"> <p><font size="-1">a) Approximately 65 staging manuals, including 1) All Verdi's operas from <i>Les V&ecirc;pres siciliennes (</i>in<i> </i>its<i> </i>censored<i> </i>Italian<i> </i>version, <i>Giovanna de Guzman</i>) to <i>Otello</i> published by Ricordi in the second half of the nineteenth century; 2) Some 45 printed and manuscript (mainly) staging manuals from Paris, where the practice of preparing staging manuals originated (several of these are printed librettos with MS annotations for staging added); 3) A group of German librettos of the best known operas by Verdi printed at the end of the nineteenth century by Reclam of Stuttgart with an appendix of staging directions and blocking diagrams included in each; 4) A group of printed Italian librettos with manuscript staging directions added either directly on the printed page or on inserted blank pages, as at Paris. <br> b) Hundreds of nineteenth-century <i>figurini (</i>costume sketches) in black and white (mainly) or color<i> </i>filmed in Milan, Parma, and Naples. Many scene designs, for the most part from printed sources, and <i>attrezzi</i> (stage implements such as swords, helmets, etc.) filmed in Trieste.<br> c) About ninety wall posters filmed at Milan, Venice, and Trieste.</font></p></blockquote>
