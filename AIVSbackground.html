      <br>
      <small>Following the Fourth International Congress of Verdi
Studies (Chicago, 1974), several participants felt the need to link the
unprecedented surge of interest in Verdi research with performances of
his music. Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, Andrew Porter, and Martin Chusid
met and began to plan. Later they were joined by Claire Brook, Patrick
Smith, and Philip Gossett. Their efforts were encouraged by Mario
Medici, founder and at that time director of the Istituto di studi
verdiani of Parma, Italy. It was their international congresses
(Venice, 1966; Verona, 1969; Milan, 1972; and Chicago, 1974) and the
publications (Bollettini, Quaderni, Atti, and now Studi) of that
organization that had fostered so much of the increased Verdi activity.<br>
      <br>
In order to provide a broad base for an American Institute for Verdi
Studies, performers, scholars, operatic organizations, critics,
publishers, librarians, and Verdi enthusiasts were
approached to serve as advisors. Their response was immediate and
enthusiastic. Such an organization, open to public membership, was
evidently both desired and needed, and on 1 April 1976 it was
officially inaugurated with a meeting of the advisory board in the
music division of Bobst Library at New York University.<br>
      <br>
The Institute publishes the <a href="verdiforum.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Verdi Forum</span></a> (formerly <span style="font-style: italic;">Verdi Newsletter</span>)
and sponsors meetings for the reading of scholarly papers, sometimes
in conjunction with the Greater New York Chapter of the American
Musicological Society. In addition to shorter conferences in Vienna
(1983), at the Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim&ograve; (1991 and 1997), and at the
Sarasota, Florida, Opera House (1994 and 1996), the Institute organized
three international congresses of Verdi studies (Danville, Kentucky,
1977; Irvine, California, 1980; and Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1993) at
which there were performances of the rarely heard first versions of <span style="font-style: italic;">Macbeth</span> (Danville) and <span style="font-style: italic;">La forza del destino</span>
(Irvine), both with scores prepared by members of the Institute's
advisory board and/or executive boards, as well as a performance of Il
trovatore in the new critical edition by David Lawton (Belfast). It
also contributed to a Verdi Congress in London at Covent Garden (1995)
and, most notably, in January 2001 it co-sponsored the joint congress
"Verdi 2001" with the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani in Parma and
the Beinecke Library at Yale University to celebrate the centenary in
2001 of the composer's death. With the loyal support of its members and
patrons, in September 2003 the AIVS inaugurated the first Postdoctoral
Fellowship in 19th Century Italian Operatic Studies to be offered at
any university in the United States.<br>
      <br>
In addition, the AIVS has sponsored concerts of Verdi's songs, arias,
and the string quartet, as well as concert performances of the original
Macbethand the first performance in the United States of Il corsaro.
The Institute has also offered a series of combined lectures and
screenings of videorecorded performances. These have included the
original version of <span style="font-style: italic;">La forza del destino</span> (remarks by Andrew Porter), La traviata (David Lawton), <span style="font-style: italic;">Otello</span> (James Hepokoski), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Un ballo in maschera</span>
(Siegmund Levarie). Recent events include benefit concerts at Weill
Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, featuring such renowned artists as Eve
Queler, Aprile Millo and Francisco Casanova, and a variety of concerts
and lectures presented in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.casaitaliananyu.org/">Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim&ograve;</a> at NYU, which remains a key partner of the AIVS during the Verdi bicentenary in 2013.<br>
      <br>Over the years the Institute's <a href="archive.html">Archive</a> has accumulated an
extensive collection of Verdi materials, primarily on microfilm. These
include films of thousands of the composer's letters, including fifteen
hundred written by Verdi to his principal publisher, the Casa Ricordi
of Milan, which donated the films. On the other side of the
correspondence there are films of many thousands of letters written to
the composer and his wife, the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi Verdi,
together with drafts of hundreds of letters from Verdi and Giuseppina.
There are, furthermore, over two hundred manuscripts of complete
orchestral scores of the Verdi operas and several hundred pezzi
staccati (individual pieces from the operas), more than twenty-two
hundred printed librettos for the composer's operas, most dating from
the nineteenth century with a vast majority stemming from Italy,
approximately sixty manuscript and printed production books or printed
librettos and piano-vocal scores with directions for staging added by
hand, and a good selection of French, German, English, and especially
Italian periodicals devoted to music and the other arts. The Institute
also holds a number of wall posters of premiere and other early
performance, as well as many films of sets and costume designs dating
from Verdi's time. Recent acquisitions include a substantial collection
of nineteenth-century librettos from the collection of the late John D.
Mazzarella, a long-time loyal member of of the AIVS. These fascinating
materials are described in the current issue of the <a href="verdiforum.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Verdi Forum</span></a> and will soon become accessible to the public in the Fales
Library &amp; Special Collections at NYU.<br>
      <br>
The bicentennial of Verdi's birth in 2013 was an exceptionally busy and
exciting time for the AIVS, which organized and hosted the
international conference <a href="thirdcentury.html">Verdi's Third Century: Italian Opera Today</a>, the exhibit <a href="https://verdiexhibit.wordpress.com/">Giuseppe Verdi: Words, Notes, Legacy</a>, and various other events and initiatives.&nbsp; Details concerning past events may be found <a href="pastevents.html">here</a>.<br>
